# Implementation Plan & Timeline

Typical implementation phases:
1. **Discovery & Requirements** — gather camera lists, network, and use cases.
2. **Pilot Deployment** — small number of cameras, validate models and rules.
3. **Scale Deployment** — deploy additional inference servers or edge devices.
4. **Handover & Training** — user manuals, admin training, and support handover.

**Assumptions**
- Access to client personnel and relevant infrastructure.
- Hosting, network and hardware readiness provided by client.
- Integrations readiness for third-party apps.
